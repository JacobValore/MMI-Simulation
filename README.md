# MMI-Simulation

This project was created as a student researcher for the [Applied Optics Group](https://photon.soe.ucsc.edu/nmoptics.htm) at UCSC. I stared by working in the lab on nanomagnet fluidics until covid guidelines removed undergraduate research from in-person lab work. At that point I transitioned to working with the optofluidics team on multi-mode interference (MMI) chips. I created this Jupyter notebook to aid in the research and creation of a Machine Learning algorithm to help with labeling optical data recieved from the MMI chips. This notebook was also created as a final project for class credit in PHYS 115: Computational Physics at UCSC.
